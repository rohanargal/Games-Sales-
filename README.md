Primary Goal:
The primary goal of this project is to analyze the Types of Gaming Platforms & Sales dataset using Excel, SQL, and Tableau and identify trends and patterns in gaming platform sales. This will help gaming companies to understand the popularity of different gaming platforms and create targeted marketing strategies, leading to increased sales and revenue.

Solution:
To achieve this goal, we will first collect the Types of Gaming Platforms & Sales dataset and preprocess the data, including handling missing values and outliers. We will then import the dataset into Excel and use various Excel functions such as pivot tables, charts, and filters to perform exploratory data analysis and identify trends and patterns in gaming platform sales.

Next, we will use SQL to query the dataset and perform more complex analysis such as calculating sales by region or by year, and identifying the top-selling games on different platforms.

Finally, we will use Tableau to create data visualizations such as heat maps, scatter plots, and bar charts to help visualize the data and identify trends. We will also create interactive dashboards to allow gaming companies to explore the data and identify trends and patterns.

Results:
The result of this project will be a comprehensive analysis of the Types of Gaming Platforms & Sales dataset, including trends and patterns in gaming platform sales. This will help gaming companies to understand the popularity of different gaming platforms and create targeted marketing strategies
